# **Voice-Assistant**

As we know Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need. 
Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing. In this article, we will look at converting large or long audio files into text using the SpeechRecognition API in python.

***What is a Voice Assistant?***
A Voice assistant is a user interface that takes the voice commands from the user and does the corresponding task. The task might be responding to the queries, connecting to the device, and doing the work specified by the user like opening google, etc. Here, we will be mimicking such a system using Python.

***Tech Used***
Language: Python

***Modules needed:***

Speech Recognition:-Since we’re building an Application of voice assistant, one of the most important things in this is that your assistant recognizes your voice (means what you want to say/ ask). To install this module type the below command in the terminal.

Pyttsx3:- This module is used for the conversion of text to speech in a program it works offline. To install this module type the below command in the terminal.

Web browser:- To perform Web Search. This module comes built-in with Python. 

Datetime:- Date and Time are used to showing Date and Time. This module comes built-in with Python. 

***We will be following the below steps to build the voice assistant:***

1. First, we import the modules.

2. Followed by this, we will be building the voice assistant and create function to speak using the voice engine

3. Then we create the function to wish, get the name of the user and command

4. Next, we will be writing functions to do various tasks like getting a weather report, sending mail, etc.

5. Finally, we write the while loop to run the assistant continuously. In which we take the command and check the command to do the respective task using if else statements.

6. Note that all the tasks we include are our choice. Depending on your comfort, you can add required commands and remove the ones that you don’t need. And make the voice assistant based on your suitability.

***A short guide to use this Voice Assistant:***
Saying "Help" will activate the Voice Assistant.
Then the given tasks that Voice Assistant can do:

    1. Set reminders: Say 'set reminder' followed by the reminder and time.
    
    2. Create to-do lists: Say 'create to-do list' and then list your tasks one by one.
    
    3. Search the web: Say 'search' followed by the search terms.
    
    4. Show available commands: Say 'help'.
    
    5. To exit, say 'exit' or 'quit'.
    
Saying the respective commands of the task that is intended will enable the Voice Assistant to do those tasks.
